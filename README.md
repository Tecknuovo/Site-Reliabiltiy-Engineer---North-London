# Site-Reliabiltiy-Engineer--North-London
Â£75,000 to Â£100,000 - AWS/GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, MongoDB

# Stack:
AWS, Kubernetes, Microservices together with Kafka/Mongo/ElasticSearch/Cockroach DB/nats/etcd clusters. Microservices are predominantly written in Go, some in Node, some Rust, some .NET. All infrastructure is in Terraform, application deployments are kubernetes manifests. All infrastructure tooling is written in Go.

# The company:
FTSE 250 going through a major technical transformation, headed up by one of the most recognised CTOâ€™s in the UK. Historically the company has grown through acquisition, bolting of various stacks to a pretty archaic systems architecture. The tech overall comes as part of a wider business object to double an already large customer base over the next 18 months.

# The culture:
Flat structure, no bureaucracy or red tape, a lot of freedom. They have a good mix of people, their Head of Architecture is a Golang x/crypto contributor, their CTO contributes to some pretty impressive hacks. Lots of autonomy. Free canteen, ping pong tables, foosball etc

# The role:
Two big items are development experience (ideally Golang).They often write tools that automate DNS setup, Google auth integration, encryption. These aren't bash scripts but Golang services with unit tests, "about" and "metrics" endpoints. On other occasions they are digging through Traefik, Prometheus, Etcd or Docker code, raising Issues or PRs.

Second part is Linux sysadmin. A lot of technologies in their stack are new, break and need debugging. They will use tcpdump to debug spurious web socket responses on reverse proxy. Use "mtr" or "traceroute" to debug connectivity, go through iptables rules, maintain a TLS certificate infrastructure.

# Project examples:
Replicate thier kubernetes setup to GCP and on-prem. On-prem cluster will consist of consumer grade hardware, Ryzen 7, OpenSCAD designed rack shelves, TAZ6 printed

# What experience is required?
As much experience with the above tech as possible
Experience in a lower-level language like Go
Familiar with infrastructure management concepts and ecosystem
Experience operating and maintaining production systems in a Linux and public cloud environment Please email Kieran@tecknuovo.com if youâ€™d like to talk through the above in more detail.

# Whatâ€™s the interview process? 
1st stage is a telephone interview with the Head of People 2nd /Final stage is a face to face where you will meet the team, complete technical assessment and cultural fit interviews â€“ typically this involves meeting numerous members of the engineering function. Offer or otherwise after that.
